# backend1
this project is absolutely far from parfect but the main aim is show my understanding of working with backend applications and display my understanding of MODEL VIEWS and CONTROLLER( M.V.C) methodology of setting up a backend server and how each folder/repositories are inter connected. in all to as well show how templating engines can be use in a project to display dynamic input.
## note
EJS templating engine is use in this project has it comes in handy as it does not require line to line conversion of html document as with PUG OR HANDLESBAR amd it allows direct injection of JavaScript code in the html file.
